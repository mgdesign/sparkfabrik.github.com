I've been a Drupal site builder from 2007 and then a Drupal Developer since the 2012, and here I'd like to tell you why creating a sandbox project was an important step for me.

## Serach API Taxonomy Term

[Search API Taxonomy Term](https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/mgorla/2639720)

- overview of the module
  * Enables a filter for Search API node indexes
  * Allows per term filtering
  * Exposes a term / index matrix in the vocabulary

<code>git clone --branch 7.x-1.x https://git.drupal.org/sandbox/mgorla/2639720.git</code>

## What it learned

**here place a nice picture**

Change of perspective

  * Perspectives 1 / From "take" to "give"
  * Perspectives 2 / From "user" to "exposed"
  * Perspectives 3 / From "one client" to "any client"

This change of perspective becomes quickly a way to think differently about your work
  Because it forces you to some practices that (maybe) you had not experienced within your work: coding standard, write documentation, exam of best practices.

  * Improve 1 / How can I highlight its usefulness?
  * Improve 2 / How can I improve its usability?
  * Improve 3 / Can I improve the code readability?

## Why it is important for a company to share

_The sandbox as a rite of passage_
Developers should be facing, expecially in open source communities, sometimes with the practices that made their job possibile. And to make this it is not enough to know the theory, the philosphy, that's the most important step, but it is the step one.

_Coaching_
In a company, coaching is very important. Marcello Testi, my coach in this adventure, did something I did not expect and that probably will change my approach to work: he trusted that I could transform something useful to one person only to something valuable to a community. That requires a good amount of trust and faith and, believe me, it is fuel to your growth as a developer. Marcello it is one of the *******fancy word meaning "important guy"******* in the italian Drupal community, so this approach couldn't come form a better source.

## So what?

So, in the end, I decided to tell you this story because I think this will be a reminder for my future self: "to give" to the community is a good way to appreciate when your work requires you "to take" from it. Each piece of code and documentation was written from someone just like you somewhere.
